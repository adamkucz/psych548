Please submit the **.Rmd** file and all output files (**.html**, **.pdf**, etc.)

## Some quick problems

1. Create an object called `myObject` and assign it a value between 1 and 100

```{r}
myObject <- 59
```

2. Add 13 to `myObject`, making sure the object itself stores the updated value

```{r}
myObject <- myObject + 13
```

3. Is `myObject` divisible by 2? by 3? by 13? by 21? Use R code to get the answer.

```{r}
myObject %% 2 == 0
myObject %% 3 == 0
myObject %% 13 == 0
myObject %% 21 == 0
```

4. How many times can 5 fit in `myObject`?

```{r}
myObject %/% 5
```

5. Add `myObject` to every element of a vector with values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

```{r}
myObject + c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

6. Fix this code (without changing any numbers) to get it to return `r 5 + 3^(3%/%2)`
```{r, echo=TRUE}
5+3^3%/%2
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
5 + 3^(3 %/% 2)
```

## R Markdown Practice

Create an R markdown document with the following components:


- A custom title (i.e., not "Untitled") and your name
- Change the theme from the default theme
- Headers 1 through 4
- An in-line R calculation
- Write the equation for the probability density function the normal distribution (R Markdown renders LaTeX style math, so Google will be your friend here!)
$$\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}$$
- A block of R code (whatever you want) that is displayed, run, but does not show output in the rendered document
```{r, results='hide'}
2 + 2
```
- A block of R code that is displayed, but is *not* run and thus does not show output in the rendered document
```{r, eval=FALSE}
2 + 2
```
- A block of R code that is not shown, but produces output in the rendered document
```{r, echo=FALSE}
2 + 2
```
- An ordered list

1. This
2. Is
  1. an ordered
  2. list!

- An unordered list

- this is an
  - unordered list!

- A link to an external website like [UW's website](https://www.washington.edu/)



- A plot, 5in $\times$ 7in that is right-aligned in the rendered document (hint: if you need help generating a random plot, copy example code at the bottom of `?plot`)
```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
Speed <- cars$speed
Distance <- cars$dist
plot(Speed, Distance, panel.first = grid(8, 8),
     pch = 0, cex = 1.2, col = "blue")
```

- A picture

- **Bold text**
- *Italicized text*
- Look online for an R package that might be useful for you in the future! This can be a package for conducting a specific type of analysis, creating certain figures, or anything else! Load the package in your markdown script and give me a two-sentence overview of the package.
- **Bonus**:
  - <u>Underlined text</u>
  - <span style="color:red;">Red text</span>
  - <span style="color:white; background-color:red;">White text with a red background</span>
  - Render a MS Word document
  - Render a PDF document
